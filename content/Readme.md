# main
 this site is for the purpose of documenting my DND 5e campaign in the kingdom of Sunhold.
if you are a part of this campaign, great! if not, well you're probably going to want to just move along, although feel free to take the information on this site and modify it into your own campaign if you choose!
this is going to sort of be a wiki for my players to use to help remember and recall any information regarding the game they may forget, as well as allow me to lore dump to my hearts content without wasting my players in game time. however, i will not be posting information that the party does not know. 

# rules
1. be kind to each other both in and out of character
2. no party infighting
3. as DM, i may have to tell you no sometimes, that is not because i don't like you or anything, but its actually for the sake of you and the rest of the party and your fun.
4.  this isn't just a game, its a story, adventure, and a journey as well. so lets have fun, enjoy the story, and make some wonderful memories
5. HAVE FUN, BE NICE, AND BE COOL.
